# VisualLoc

VisualLoc is a library built to unify the research in the field of visual place recognition.
It is the case that many state of the art algorithms reported in the literature are deployed
on slightly different configured datasets, making it difficult to determine state of the art. 
This repositoy implements over 10 of the best Visual Place Techniques currently available. 

The repository also provides a framework to build, design, train, deploy and evaluate new 
visual place recognition methods, thereby serving the research communities in visual navigation 
and place recognition.
